        <div class="about">
        <p>At The Duke's Herald, we all share the passion to create something extraordinary. We strive to deliver world class experiences, so we demand the very best from ourselves. For us, creativity is not a skill with any one individual so much as a mindset. By exercising a flat hierarchy and nurturing an attentive design process, we listen to all the crazy ideas thrown around the office. We believe there is no better place to grow professionally, find new friends, and kick back after a hard dayâ€™s work.
		   Founded in 2014 by six friends from the University of Amsterdam, The Duke's Herald (then IN-09) created the cult hit My Little Pony for the PC. One year later, the pivotal Oenka-Boenka 8500 B.C. - MMO in 2015 would change the future of online gaming and The Duke's Herald forever. Today, the studio develops Minesweeper Online. And we are just getting warmed up.</p>
